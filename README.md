Greetings fellow developers and scientists,

My full name is Jorge Miguel Fortes Gon√ßalves and I'm from Porto, in Portugal.

I'm naturally curious about all branches of science, but I show much more interest in physics, mathematics and computer science.

I'm currently learning more about other programming languages besides the one I'm used to - Python; and basic computer science theory.

I have a background in physics and, from now on, I'm committing myself to articulate concepts and structures from the three aforementioned fields into neat projects.

Feel free to contact me at jorgegoncalves1992@protonmail.com if you're interested in inviting me to collaborate on a low to mid complexity level project.
